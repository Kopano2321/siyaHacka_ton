üå± Project Overview: ‚ÄúAgriGuard‚Äù (or whatever name you choose)
Problem

Small-scale and subsistence farmers in South Africa face unpredictable rainfall, extreme weather, and limited access to climate information. This leads to crop losses and reduced food security.

Goal

Create a web app that helps farmers:

Track their crops and watering activity.

Receive weather-based alerts (e.g., drought, frost, heavy rain).

Know when to water, when to harvest, and how to care for their specific crop type.

Get personalized insights based on crop type and local weather.

üß© Key Features
1. Farmer & Crop Management

Farmers register/login.

Farmers add their crops:

Crop name (e.g., maize, spinach, tomatoes)

Location (province, coordinates, or village)

Date planted

Growth stage

The app keeps track of crop lifecycle using known growth durations for each crop (you can store this in a table).

2. Weather & Irrigation Tracker

Integrate with a weather API (like OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI).

Automatically fetch:

Recent rainfall

Temperature

Humidity

Combine this with a watering log:

Farmer logs manual watering.

System checks if the crop received enough water recently.

If not ‚Üí send alert: ‚ÄúYour maize in Nongoma hasn‚Äôt received rain in 5 days, please water soon.‚Äù

3. Extreme Weather Alerts

If forecast shows extreme weather (hail, frost, heatwave, flooding):

Send SMS or email alert.

Suggest preventive actions (e.g., cover seedlings, harvest early).

4. Crop Lifecycle Tracking

Based on crop type and date planted:

Estimate current stage (germination, vegetative, flowering, harvest).

Send timely care instructions.

Notify when harvest time approaches.

5. Dashboard for Farmers

Display:

List of crops and their current stage.

Weather conditions for each location.

Alerts & notifications.

Last watering date.

Harvest readiness indicator.
